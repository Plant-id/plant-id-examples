[Plant.id](https://plant.id) offers a plant identification service based on machine learning. Once you [obtain the API key](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/), you can use these client's code to speed-up the development of your implementation.

# API reference
## Identification
```https://api.plant.id/identify```

Sends plant photos to our backend, queues the request, and returns its identification.

### Request
There are two required parameters:
- **`key`**- your [API key](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/)
- **`images`** - one ore more images of the plant you want to identify (string - base64 or a file)

The list of optional parameters:
- `custom_id` - identifier you can set for your purpose
<!--- `custom_url` - backlink, your web representation of this identification-->
- `callback_url` - URL where we POST results after identification is completed
- `latitude` - geographic coordinate (float)
- `longitude` - geographic coordinate (float)
- `parameters` - list of strings which specify the speed & accuracy of the identification (`crops_simple`, `crops_fast` - default, `crops_medium`) or allows displaying of similar images (`similar_images`) -> **If you want to get similar images in the response, you must include item `similar_images` here.
- `date` - time in milliseconds (int)
<!--- `week` - week in year (int)-->
<!--- `usage_info` - info about API usage and limits, e. g. how many identifications letf (bool)-->
- `wait_for_identification` - allow to wait some time for identification to finish (and avoid check_identifications call). If the parameter is numerical, it is interpreted as maximal waiting time in seconds (max. 20 s). (bool, float, int)
- `lang` - language code ([ISO 639-1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)) used for common names and URLs of plants (default "en")


### Result
The result is a list of records showing possible plant species (taxons). Each record contains:
- `name` - the scientific name of the plant
- `url` - link to Wikipedia or Google
- `common_name` - the common name of the plant
- `probability` - certainty level that suggested plant is the one from the photo
- `similar_images` - representative images of the identified species carefully selected by the model, so it resembles the input image (Similar images are includede in the result only if you add the value `similar_image` in the `parameters` list of the reques.)
- `confirmed` - confirmation status

Record example:

    }
  ],
  "confirmed": false
}
```

## Check
```https://api.plant.id/check_identifications```

Checks if identifications with given ids have been already proceeded and eventually returns their result.

### Request
When sending the check request, specify your API key and the list of given ids OR your custom ids:

- **`key`**- your [API key](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/)
- **`ids`** - list of ids provided by the identification response
- **`custom_ids`** - list of ids provided by you in the identification request
- `lang` - language code ([ISO 639-1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)) used for common names and URLs of plants (default "en")

### Response
You get a list with info about your identifications with given ids. Apart from getting the info you sent with the identification request and the identification result, you can get the following:

- `created` - when was the identification request created
- `sent` - when was the request sent to identification
- `classified` - when was the request classified
<!--- `feedback`-->
- `fail_cause` - cause of the failed identification
- `countable` - whether the identification meets the required properties to be countable according to SLA
